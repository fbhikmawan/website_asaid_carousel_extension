                        For this setting, we need to always force the style (= if the block
                        is naturally 800px tall and the user enters 800px for this setting,
                        we set 800px as inline style anyway). Indeed, this snippet's style
                        is based on the height that is forced but once the related public
                        widgets are started, the inner carousel items receive a min-height
                        which makes it so the snippet "natural" height is equal to the
                        initially forced height... so if the style is not forced, it would
                        ultimately be removed by mistake thinking it is not necessary.
                        Note: this is forced as not important as we still need the height to
                        be reset to 'auto' in mobile (generic css rules).
